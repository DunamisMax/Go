# Go Code Repository by [dunamismax](https://github.com/dunamismax)

Welcome to my personal Go code repository! Here, I’m learning, experimenting, and building various programs with the Go programming language. You’ll find both my own hand-written code and code generated with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Structure

- **My-code/**
  Contains projects, exercises, and examples that I have written myself. These serve as my personal learning sandbox, demonstrating my growing familiarity with Go’s syntax, idioms, and best practices.

- **LLM-code/**
  Contains code snippets and projects generated by Large Language Models (specifically o1-pro). I use these as reference points, learning tools, and starting templates. Over time, I’ll iterate on this code, adding my own improvements and commentary.

## About Me

I’m currently learning Go and documenting my progress here. If you’d like to follow along or learn more, feel free to check out my [website](https://dunamismax.com). I’m excited to share my journey and hopefully help others along the way.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning project, I welcome suggestions, tips, or constructive feedback through issues and pull requests. Let’s learn Go together!
